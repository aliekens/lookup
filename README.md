lookup
======

http://lookup.liekens.net is a service that provides .ics versions of ISS flybys, so you can monitor flybys with your calendar software and get your phone to warn you of upcoming flybys.

lookup was written in Ruby using Sinatra. The source was published to search for ways to minimise load on our provider of ISS flyby predictions, http://www.heavens-above.com
